== Assignment 1: Neural Machine Translation

Welcome to the first assignment of Course 4. Here, you will build an
English-to-German neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention. Machine translation is
an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not
only for translating one language to another but also for word sense
disambiguation (e.g.Â determining whether the word ``bank'' refers to the
financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using
just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to
medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very
long sequences. To solve this, you will be adding an attention mechanism
to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence
regardless of its length. By completing this assignment, you will:

* learn how to preprocess your training and evaluation data
* implement an encoder-decoder system with attention
* understand how attention works
* build the NMT model from scratch using Trax
* generate translations using greedy and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR)

# Part 1: Data Preparation

## 1.1 Importing the Data

We will first start by importing the packages we will use in this
assignment. As in the previous course of this specialization, we will
use the https://github.com/google/trax[Trax] library created and
maintained by the https://research.google/teams/brain/[Google Brain
team] to do most of the heavy lifting. It provides submodules to fetch
and process the datasets, as well as build and train the model.

You should consider upgrading via the '/opt/conda/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.[0m
----

Next, we will import the dataset we will use to train the model. To meet
the storage constraints in this lab environment, we will just use a
small dataset from http://opus.nlpl.eu/[Opus], a growing collection of
translated texts from the web. Particularly, we will get an English to
German translation subset specified as `opus/medical` which has medical
related texts. If storage is not an issue, you can opt to get a larger
corpus such as the English to German translation dataset from
https://paracrawl.eu/[ParaCrawl], a large multi-lingual translation
dataset created by the European Union. Both of these datasets are
available via https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets[Tensorflow Datasets
(TFDS)] and you can browse through the other available datasets
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview[here]. We have
downloaded the data for you in the `data/` directory of your workspace.
As youâ€™ll see below, you can easily access this dataset from TFDS with
`trax.data.TFDS`. The result is a python generator function yielding
tuples. Use the `keys` argument to select what appears at which position
in the tuple. For example, `keys=('en', 'de')` below will return pairs
as (English sentence, German sentence).


+*In[2]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Get generator function for the training set
# This will download the train dataset if no data_dir is specified.
train_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('opus/medical',
                                 data_dir='./data/',
                                 keys=('en', 'de'),
                                 eval_holdout_size=0.01, # 1% for eval
                                 train=True)

# Get generator function for the eval set
eval_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('opus/medical',
                                data_dir='./data/',
                                keys=('en', 'de'),
                                eval_holdout_size=0.01, # 1% for eval
                                train=False)
----

Notice that TFDS returns a generator _function_, not a generator. This
is because in Python, you cannot reset generators so you cannot go back
to a previously yielded value. During deep learning training, you use
Stochastic Gradient Descent and donâ€™t actually need to go back â€“ but it
is sometimes good to be able to do that, and thatâ€™s where the functions
come in. It is actually very common to use generator functions in Python
â€“ e.g., `zip` is a generator function. You can read more about
https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/generators.html[Python generators]
to understand why we use them. Letâ€™s print a a sample pair from our
train and eval data. Notice that the raw ouput is represented in bytes
(denoted by the `b'` prefix) and these will be converted to strings
internally in the next steps.

print(colored('train data (en, de) tuple:', 'red'), next(train_stream))
print()

eval_stream = eval_stream_fn()

## 1.2 Tokenization and Formatting

Now that we have imported our corpus, we will be preprocessing the
sentences into a format that our model can accept. This will be composed
of several steps:

*Tokenizing the sentences using subword representations:* As youâ€™ve
learned in the earlier courses of this specialization, we want to
represent each sentence as an array of integers instead of strings. For
our application, we will use _subword_ representations to tokenize our
sentences. This is a common technique to avoid out-of-vocabulary words
by allowing parts of words to be represented separately. For example,
instead of having separate entries in your vocabulary for â€“``fear'',
``fearless'', ``fearsome'', ``some'', and ``less''â€“, you can simply
store â€“``fear'', ``some'', and ``less''â€“ then allow your tokenizer to
combine these subwords when needed. This allows it to be more flexible
so you wonâ€™t have to save uncommon words explicitly in your vocabulary
(e.g.Â _stylebender_, _nonce_, etc). Tokenizing is done with the
`trax.data.Tokenize()` command and we have provided you the combined
subword vocabulary for English and German (i.e.Â `ende_32k.subword`)
saved in the `data` directory. Feel free to open this file to see how
the subwords look like.


+*In[4]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# global variables that state the filename and directory of the vocabulary file
VOCAB_FILE = 'ende_32k.subword'
VOCAB_DIR = 'data/'

# Tokenize the dataset.
tokenized_train_stream = trax.data.Tokenize(vocab_file=VOCAB_FILE, vocab_dir=VOCAB_DIR)(train_stream)
tokenized_eval_stream = trax.data.Tokenize(vocab_file=VOCAB_FILE, vocab_dir=VOCAB_DIR)(eval_stream)
----

*Append an end-of-sentence token to each sentence:* We will assign a
token (i.e.Â in this case `1`) to mark the end of a sentence. This will
be useful in inference/prediction so weâ€™ll know that the model has
completed the translation.


+*In[5]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Append EOS at the end of each sentence.

# Integer assigned as end-of-sentence (EOS)
EOS = 1

# generator helper function to append EOS to each sentence
def append_eos(stream):
    for (inputs, targets) in stream:
        inputs_with_eos = list(inputs) + [EOS]
        targets_with_eos = list(targets) + [EOS]
        yield np.array(inputs_with_eos), np.array(targets_with_eos)

# append EOS to the train data
tokenized_train_stream = append_eos(tokenized_train_stream)

# append EOS to the eval data
tokenized_eval_stream = append_eos(tokenized_eval_stream)
----

*Filter long sentences:* We will place a limit on the number of tokens
per sentence to ensure we wonâ€™t run out of memory. This is done with the
`trax.data.FilterByLength()` method and you can see its syntax below.


+*In[6]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Filter too long sentences to not run out of memory.
# length_keys=[0, 1] means we filter both English and German sentences, so
# both much be not longer that 256 tokens for training / 512 for eval.
filtered_train_stream = trax.data.FilterByLength(
    max_length=256, length_keys=[0, 1])(tokenized_train_stream)
filtered_eval_stream = trax.data.FilterByLength(
    max_length=512, length_keys=[0, 1])(tokenized_eval_stream)

# print a sample input-target pair of tokenized sentences
train_input, train_target = next(filtered_train_stream)
print(colored(f'Single tokenized example input:', 'red' ), train_input)
print(colored(f'Single tokenized example target:', 'red'), train_target)

## 1.3 tokenize & detokenize helper functions

Given any data set, you have to be able to map words to their indices,
and indices to their words. The inputs and outputs to your trax models
are usually tensors of numbers where each number corresponds to a word.
If you were to process your data manually, you would have to make use of
the following:

*  word2Ind: a dictionary mapping the word to its index.
*  ind2Word: a dictionary mapping the index to its word.
*  word2Count: a dictionary mapping the word to the number of times it
appears.
*  num_words: total number of words that have appeared.

Since you have already implemented these in previous assignments of the
specialization, we will provide you with helper functions that will do
this for you. Run the cell below to get the following functions:

*  tokenize(): converts a text sentence to its corresponding token list
(i.e.Â list of indices). Also converts words to subwords (parts of
words).
*  detokenize(): converts a token list to its corresponding sentence
(i.e.Â string).

## 1.4 Bucketing

Bucketing the tokenized sentences is an important technique used to
speed up training in NLP. Here is a
https://medium.com/@rashmi.margani/how-to-speed-up-the-training-of-the-sequence-model-using-bucketing-techniques-9e302b0fd976[nice
article describing it in detail] but the gist is very simple. Our inputs
have variable lengths and you want to make these the same when batching
groups of sentences together. One way to do that is to pad each sentence
to the length of the longest sentence in the dataset. This might lead to
some wasted computation though. For example, if there are multiple short
sentences with just two tokens, do we want to pad these when the longest
sentence is composed of a 100 tokens? Instead of padding with 0s to the
maximum length of a sentence each time, we can group our tokenized
sentences by length and bucket, as on this image (from the article
above):

image:https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*hcGuja_d5Z_rFcgwe9dPow.png[alt
text]

We batch the sentences with similar length together (e.g.Â the blue
sentences in the image above) and only add minimal padding to make them
have equal length (usually up to the nearest power of two). This allows
to waste less computation when processing padded sequences. In Trax, it
is implemented in the
https://github.com/google/trax/blob/5fb8aa8c5cb86dabb2338938c745996d5d87d996/trax/supervised/inputs.py#L378[bucket_by_length]
function.


+*In[10]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# Bucketing to create streams of batches.

# Buckets are defined in terms of boundaries and batch sizes.
# Batch_sizes[i] determines the batch size for items with length < boundaries[i]
# So below, we'll take a batch of 256 sentences of length < 8, 128 if length is
# between 8 and 16, and so on -- and only 2 if length is over 512.
boundaries =  [8,   16,  32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
batch_sizes = [256, 128, 64, 32, 16,    8,   4,  2]

# Create the generators.
train_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes,
    length_keys=[0, 1]  # As before: count inputs and targets to length.
)(filtered_train_stream)

eval_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes,
    length_keys=[0, 1]  # As before: count inputs and targets to length.
)(filtered_eval_stream)

# Add masking for the padding (0s).
train_batch_stream = trax.data.AddLossWeights(id_to_mask=0)(train_batch_stream)
eval_batch_stream = trax.data.AddLossWeights(id_to_mask=0)(eval_batch_stream)
----

## 1.5 Exploring the data

We will now be displaying some of our data. You will see that the
functions defined above (i.e.Â `tokenize()` and `detokenize()`) do the
same things you have been doing again and again throughout the
specialization. We gave these so you can focus more on building the
model from scratch. Let us first get the data generator and get one
batch of the data.


+*In[11]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
input_batch, target_batch, mask_batch = next(train_batch_stream)

# let's see the data type of a batch
print("input_batch data type: ", type(input_batch))
print("target_batch data type: ", type(target_batch))

# let's see the shape of this particular batch (batch length, sentence length)
print("input_batch shape: ", input_batch.shape)
print("target_batch shape: ", target_batch.shape)
----


+*Out[11]:*+
----
input_batch data type:  <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
target_batch data type:  <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
input_batch shape:  (32, 64)
target_batch shape:  (32, 64)
----

The `input_batch` and `target_batch` are Numpy arrays consisting of
tokenized English sentences and German sentences respectively. These
tokens will later be used to produce embedding vectors for each word in
the sentence (so the embedding for a sentence will be a matrix). The
number of sentences in each batch is usually a power of 2 for optimal
computer memory usage.

We can now visually inspect some of the data. You can run the cell below
several times to shuffle through the sentences. Just to note, while this
is a standard data set that is used widely, it does have some known
wrong translations. With that, letâ€™s pick a random sentence and print
its tokenized representation.


+*In[12]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# pick a random index less than the batch size.
index = random.randrange(len(input_batch))

# use the index to grab an entry from the input and target batch
print(colored('THIS IS THE ENGLISH SENTENCE: \n', 'red'), detokenize(input_batch[index], vocab_file=VOCAB_FILE, vocab_dir=VOCAB_DIR), '\n')
print(colored('THIS IS THE TOKENIZED VERSION OF THE ENGLISH SENTENCE: \n ', 'red'), input_batch[index], '\n')
print(colored('THIS IS THE GERMAN TRANSLATION: \n', 'red'), detokenize(target_batch[index], vocab_file=VOCAB_FILE, vocab_dir=VOCAB_DIR), '\n')
print(colored('THIS IS THE TOKENIZED VERSION OF THE GERMAN TRANSLATION: \n', 'red'), target_batch[index], '\n')

# Part 2: Neural Machine Translation with Attention

Now that you have the data generators and have handled the
preprocessing, it is time for you to build the model. You will be
implementing a neural machine translation model from scratch with
attention.

## 2.1 Attention Overview

The model we will be building uses an encoder-decoder architecture. This
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) will take in a tokenized version of a
sentence in its encoder, then passes it on to the decoder for
translation. As mentioned in the lectures, just using a a regular
sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs will work effectively for short to
medium sentences but will start to degrade for longer ones. You can
picture it like the figure below where all of the context of the input
sentence is compressed into one vector that is passed into the decoder
block. You can see how this will be an issue for very long sentences
(e.g.Â 100 tokens or more) because the context of the first parts of the
input will have very little effect on the final vector passed to the
decoder.

Adding an attention layer to this model avoids this problem by giving
the decoder access to all parts of the input sentence. To illustrate,
letâ€™s just use a 4-word input sentence as shown below. Remember that a
hidden state is produced at each timestep of the encoder (represented by
the orange rectangles). These are all passed to the attention layer and
each are given a score given the current activation (i.e.Â hidden state)
of the decoder. For instance, letâ€™s consider the figure below where the
first prediction ``Wie'' is already made. To produce the next
prediction, the attention layer will first receive all the encoder
hidden states (i.e.Â orange rectangles) as well as the decoder hidden
state when producing the word ``Wie'' (i.e.Â first green rectangle).
Given these information, it will score each of the encoder hidden states
to know which one the decoder should focus on to produce the next word.
The result of the model training might have learned that it should align
to the second encoder hidden state and subsequently assigns a high
probability to the word ``geht''. If we are using greedy decoding, we
will output the said word as the next symbol, then restart the process
to produce the next word until we reach an end-of-sentence prediction.

There are different ways to implement attention and the one weâ€™ll use
for this assignment is the Scaled Dot Product Attention which has the
form:

[latexmath]
++++
\[Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V\]
++++

You will dive deeper into this equation in the next week but for now,
you can think of it as computing scores using queries (Q) and keys (K),
followed by a multiplication of values (V) to get a context vector at a
particular timestep of the decoder. This context vector is fed to the
decoder RNN to get a set of probabilities for the next predicted word.
The division by square root of the keys dimensionality
(latexmath:[$\sqrt{d_k}$]) is for improving model performance and youâ€™ll
also learn more about it next week. For our machine translation
application, the encoder activations (i.e.Â encoder hidden states) will
be the keys and values, while the decoder activations (i.e.Â decoder
hidden states) will be the queries.

You will see in the upcoming sections that this complex architecture and
mechanism can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Letâ€™s get
started!

## 2.2 Helper functions

We will first implement a few functions that we will use later on. These
will be for the input encoder, pre-attention decoder, and preparation of
the queries, keys, values, and mask.

== 2.2.1 Input encoder

The input encoder runs on the input tokens, creates its embeddings, and
feeds it to an LSTM network. This outputs the activations that will be
the keys and values for attention. It is a
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial[Serial]
network which uses:

* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Embedding[tl.Embedding]:
Converts each token to its vector representation. In this case, it is
the the size of the vocabulary by the dimension of the model:
`tl.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)`. `vocab_size` is the number of
entries in the given vocabulary. `d_model` is the number of elements in
the word embedding.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM[tl.LSTM]:
LSTM layer of size `d_model`. We want to be able to configure how many
encoder layers we have so remember to create LSTM layers equal to the
number of the `n_encoder_layers` parameter.

### Exercise 01

*Instructions:* Implement the `input_encoder_fn` function.

def input_encoder_fn(input_vocab_size, d_model, n_encoder_layers):

    Args:
        input_vocab_size: int: vocab size of the input
        d_model: int:  depth of embedding (n_units in the LSTM cell)
        n_encoder_layers: int: number of LSTM layers in the encoder
    Returns:
        tl.Serial: The input encoder
    """
    
    # create a serial network
    input_encoder = tl.Serial( 
        
        ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF `None` WITH YOUR CODE) ###
        # create an embedding layer to convert tokens to vectors
        tl.Embedding(input_vocab_size, d_model),
        
        # feed the embeddings to the LSTM layers. It is a stack of n_encoder_layers LSTM layers
        [tl.LSTM(d_model) for _ in range(n_encoder_layers)],

== 2.2.2 Pre-attention decoder

The pre-attention decoder runs on the targets and creates activations
that are used as queries in attention. This is a Serial network which is
composed of the following:

* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.ShiftRight[tl.ShiftRight]:
This pads a token to the beginning of your target tokens
(e.g.Â `[8, 34, 12]` shifted right is `[0, 8, 34, 12]`). This will act
like a start-of-sentence token that will be the first input to the
decoder. During training, this shift also allows the target tokens to be
passed as input to do teacher forcing.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Embedding[tl.Embedding]:
Like in the previous function, this converts each token to its vector
representation. In this case, it is the the size of the vocabulary by
the dimension of the model: `tl.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)`.
`vocab_size` is the number of entries in the given vocabulary. `d_model`
is the number of elements in the word embedding.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM[tl.LSTM]:
LSTM layer of size `d_model`.

== 2.2.3 Preparing the attention input

This function will prepare the inputs to the attention layer. We want to
take in the encoder and pre-attention decoder activations and assign it
to the queries, keys, and values. In addition, another output here will
be the mask to distinguish real tokens from padding tokens. This mask
will be used internally by Trax when computing the softmax so padding
tokens will not have an effect on the computated probabilities. From the
data preparation steps in Section 1 of this assignment, you should know
which tokens in the input correspond to padding.

We have filled the last two lines in composing the mask for you because
it includes a concept that will be discussed further next week. This is
related to _multiheaded attention_ which you can think of right now as
computing the attention multiple times to improve the modelâ€™s
predictions. It is required to consider this additional axis in the
output so weâ€™ve included it already but you donâ€™t need to analyze it
just yet. Whatâ€™s important now is for you to know which should be the
queries, keys, and values, as well as to initialize the mask.

## 2.3 Implementation Overview

We are now ready to implement our sequence-to-sequence model with
attention. This will be a Serial network and is illustrated in the
diagram below. It shows the layers youâ€™ll be using in Trax and youâ€™ll
see that each step can be implemented quite easily with one line
commands. Weâ€™ve placed several links to the documentation for each
relevant layer in the discussion after the figure below.

### Exercise 04 *Instructions:* Implement the `NMTAttn` function below
to define your machine translation model which uses attention. We have
left hyperlinks below pointing to the Trax documentation of the relevant
layers. Remember to consult it to get tips on what parameters to pass.

*Step 0:* Prepare the input encoder and pre-attention decoder branches.
You have already defined this earlier as helper functions so itâ€™s just a
matter of calling those functions and assigning it to variables.

*Step 1:* Create a Serial network. This will stack the layers in the
next steps one after the other. Like the earlier exercises, you can use
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial[tl.Serial].

*Step 2:* Make a copy of the input and target tokens. As you see in the
diagram above, the input and target tokens will be fed into different
layers of the model. You can use
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select[tl.Select]
layer to create copies of these tokens. Arrange them as
`[input tokens, target tokens, input tokens, target tokens]`.

*Step 3:* Create a parallel branch to feed the input tokens to the
`input_encoder` and the target tokens to the `pre_attention_decoder`.
You can use
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel[tl.Parallel]
to create these sublayers in parallel. Remember to pass the variables
you defined in Step 0 as parameters to this layer.

*Step 4:* Next, call the `prepare_attention_input` function to convert
the encoder and pre-attention decoder activations to a format that the
attention layer will accept. You can use
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn[tl.Fn]
to call this function. Note: Pass the `prepare_attention_input` function
as the `f` parameter in `tl.Fn` without any arguments or parenthesis.

*Step 5:* We will now feed the (queries, keys, values, and mask) to the
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.AttentionQKV[tl.AttentionQKV]
layer. This computes the scaled dot product attention and outputs the
attention weights and mask. Take note that although it is a one liner,
this layer is actually composed of a deep network made up of several
branches. Weâ€™ll show the implementation taken
https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/layers/attention.py#L61[here]
to see the different layers used.

[source,python]
----
def AttentionQKV(d_feature, n_heads=1, dropout=0.0, mode='train'):
  """Returns a layer that maps (q, k, v, mask) to (activations, mask).

  See `Attention` above for further context/details.

  Args:
    d_feature: Depth/dimensionality of feature embedding.
    n_heads: Number of attention heads.
    dropout: Probababilistic rate for internal dropout applied to attention
        activations (based on query-key pairs) before dotting them with values.
    mode: Either 'train' or 'eval'.
  """
  return cb.Serial(
      cb.Parallel(
          core.Dense(d_feature),
          core.Dense(d_feature),
          core.Dense(d_feature),
      ),
      PureAttention(  # pylint: disable=no-value-for-parameter
          n_heads=n_heads, dropout=dropout, mode=mode),
      core.Dense(d_feature),
  )
----

Having deep layers pose the risk of vanishing gradients during training
and we would want to mitigate that. To improve the ability of the
network to learn, we can insert a
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual[tl.Residual]
layer to add the output of AttentionQKV with the `queries` input. You
can do this in trax by simply nesting the `AttentionQKV` layer inside
the `Residual` layer. The library will take care of branching and adding
for you.

*Step 6:* We will not need the mask for the model weâ€™re building so we
can safely drop it. At this point in the network, the signal stack
currently has `[attention activations, mask, target tokens]` and you can
use
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select[tl.Select]
to output just `[attention activations, target tokens]`.

*Step 7:* We can now feed the attention weighted output to the LSTM
decoder. We can stack multiple
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM[tl.LSTM]
layers to improve the output so remember to append LSTMs equal to the
number defined by `n_decoder_layers` parameter to the model.

*Step 8:* We want to determine the probabilities of each subword in the
vocabulary and you can set this up easily with a
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense[tl.Dense]
layer by making its size equal to the size of our vocabulary.

*Step 9:* Normalize the output to log probabilities by passing the
activations in Step 8 to a
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.LogSoftmax[tl.LogSoftmax]
layer.

# Part 3: Training

We will now be training our model in this section. Doing supervised
training in Trax is pretty straightforward (short example
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/trax_intro.html#Supervised-training[here]).
We will be instantiating three classes for this: `TrainTask`,
`EvalTask`, and `Loop`. Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of these in the
sections below.

## 3.1 TrainTask

The
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.TrainTask[TrainTask]
class allows us to define the labeled data to use for training and the
feedback mechanisms to compute the loss and update the weights.

The
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.EvalTask[EvalTask]

## 3.3 Loop

The
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.Loop[Loop]

tasks to execute. Its `run()` method allows us to execute the training

# Part 4: Testing

We will now be using the model you just trained to translate English
sentences to German. We will implement this with two functions: The
first allows you to identify the next symbol (i.e.Â output token). The
second one takes care of combining the entire translated string.

We will start by first loading in a pre-trained copy of the model you
just coded. Please run the cell below to do just that.

model = NMTAttn(mode='eval')

# initialize weights from a pre-trained model
model.init_from_file("model.pkl.gz", weights_only=True)
model = tl.Accelerate(model)

## 4.1 Decoding

As discussed in the lectures, there are several ways to get the next
token when translating a sentence. For instance, we can just get the
most probable token at each step (i.e.Â greedy decoding) or get a sample
from a distribution. We can generalize the implementation of these two
approaches by using the `tl.logsoftmax_sample()` method. Letâ€™s briefly
look at its implementation:

[source,python]
----
def logsoftmax_sample(log_probs, temperature=1.0):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
  """Returns a sample from a log-softmax output, with temperature.

  Args:
    log_probs: Logarithms of probabilities (often coming from LogSofmax)
    temperature: For scaling before sampling (1.0 = default, 0.0 = pick argmax)
  """
  # This is equivalent to sampling from a softmax with temperature.
  u = np.random.uniform(low=1e-6, high=1.0 - 1e-6, size=log_probs.shape)
  g = -np.log(-np.log(u))
  return np.argmax(log_probs + g * temperature, axis=-1)
----

The key things to take away here are: 1. it gets random samples with the
same shape as your input (i.e.Â `log_probs`), and 2. the amount of
``noise'' added to the input by these random samples is scaled by a
`temperature` setting. Youâ€™ll notice that setting it to `0` will just
make the return statement equal to getting the argmax of `log_probs`.
This will come in handy later.

### Exercise 06

*Instructions:* Implement the `next_symbol()` function that takes in the
`input_tokens` and the `cur_output_tokens`, then return the index of the
next word. You can click below for hints in completing this exercise.

Click Here for Hints

To get the next power of two, you can compute 2^log_2(token_length + 1)
. We add 1 to avoid log(0).

You can use np.ceil() to get the ceiling of a float.

np.log2() will get the logarithm base 2 of a value

int() will cast a value into an integer type

From the model diagram in part 2, you know that it takes two inputs. You
can feed these with this syntax to get the model outputs: model((input1,
input2)). Itâ€™s up to you to determine which variables below to
substitute for input1 and input2. Remember also from the diagram that
the output has two elements: [log probabilities, target tokens]. You
wonâ€™t need the target tokens so we assigned it to _ below for you.

The log probabilities output will have the shape: (batch size, decoder
length, vocab size). It will contain log probabilities for each token in
the cur_output_tokens plus 1 for the start symbol introduced by the
ShiftRight in the preattention decoder. For example, if
cur_output_tokens is [1, 2, 5], the model will output an array of log
probabilities each for tokens 0 (start symbol), 1, 2, and 5. To generate
the next symbol, you just want to get the log probabilities associated
with the last token (i.e.Â token 5 at index 3). You can slice the model
output at [0, 3, :] to get this. It will be up to you to generalize this
for any length of cur_output_tokens

Now you will implement the `sampling_decode()` function. This will call
the `next_symbol()` function above several times until the next output
is the end-of-sentence token (i.e.Â `EOS`). It takes in an input string
and returns the translated version of that string.

We have set a default value of `0` to the temperature setting in our
implementation of `sampling_decode()` above. As you may have noticed in
the `logsoftmax_sample()` method, this setting will ultimately result in
greedy decoding. As mentioned in the lectures, this algorithm generates
the translation by getting the most probable word at each step. It gets
the argmax of the output array of your model and then returns that
index. See the testing function and sample inputs below. Youâ€™ll notice
that the output will remain the same each time you run it.

## 4.2 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding

As mentioned in the lectures, getting the most probable token at each
step may not necessarily produce the best results. Another approach is
to do Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding or MBR. The general steps to implement
this are:

[arabic]
. take several random samples
. score each sample against all other samples
. select the one with the highest score

You will be building helper functions for these steps in the following
sections.

### 4.2.1 Generating samples

First, letâ€™s build a function to generate several samples. You can use
the `sampling_decode()` function you developed earlier to do this
easily. We want to record the token list and log probability for each
sample as these will be needed in the next step.

== 4.2.2 Comparing overlaps

Let us now build our functions to compare a sample against another.
There are several metrics available as shown in the lectures and you can
try experimenting with any one of these. For this assignment, we will be
calculating scores for unigram overlaps. One of the more simple metrics
is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index[Jaccard similarity]

implemented it below for your perusal.

One of the more commonly used metrics in machine translation is the
ROUGE score. For unigrams, this is called ROUGE-1 and as shown in class,
you can output the scores for both precision and recall when comparing
two samples. To get the final score, you will want to compute the
F1-score as given by:

[latexmath]
++++
\[score = 2* \frac{(precision * recall)}{(precision + recall)}\]

== 4.2.3 Overall score

We will now build a function to generate the overall score for a
particular sample. As mentioned earlier, we need to compare each sample
with all other samples. For instance, if we generated 30 sentences, we
will need to compare sentence 1 to sentences 2 to 30. Then, we compare
sentence 2 to sentences 1 and 3 to 30, and so forth. At each step, we
get the average score of all comparisons to get the overall score for a
particular sample. To illustrate, these will be the steps to generate
the scores of a 4-sample list.

[arabic]
. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 2
. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 3
. Get similarity score between sample 1 and sample 4
. Get average score of the first 3 steps. This will be the overall score
of sample 1.
. Iterate and repeat until samples 1 to 4 have overall scores.

We will be storing the results in a dictionary for easy lookups.

== 4.2.4 Putting it all together

We will now put everything together and develop the `mbr_decode()`
function. Please use the helper functions you just developed to complete
this. You will want to generate samples, get the score for each sample,
get the highest score among all samples, then detokenize this sample to
get the translated sentence.

### Exercise 10

*Instructions*: Implement the `mbr_overlap()` function.

def mbr_decode(sentence, n_samples, score_fn, similarity_fn, NMTAttn=None, temperature=0.6, vocab_file=None, vocab_dir=None):
    """Returns the translated sentence using Minimum Bayes Risk decoding

    Args:
        sentence (str): sentence to translate.
        n_samples (int): number of samples to generate
        score_fn (function): function that generates the score for each sample
        similarity_fn (function): function used to compute the overlap between a pair of samples
        NMTAttn (tl.Serial): An LSTM sequence-to-sequence model with attention.
        temperature (float): parameter for sampling ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
            0.0: same as argmax, always pick the most probable token
            1.0: sampling from the distribution (can sometimes say random things)
        vocab_file (str): filename of the vocabulary
        vocab_dir (str): path to the vocabulary file

    Returns:
        str: the translated sentence

== Congratulations! Next week, youâ€™ll dive deeper into attention models and study the Transformer architecture. You will build another network but without the recurrent part. It will show that attention is all you need! It should be fun!
