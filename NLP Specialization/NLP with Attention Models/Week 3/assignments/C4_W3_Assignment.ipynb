== Assignment 3: Question Answering

Welcome to this week’s assignment of course 4. In this you will explore
question answering. You will implement the ``Text to Text Transfer from
Transformers'' (better known as T5). Since you implemented transformers
from scratch last week you will now be able to use them.

### Overview

This assignment will be different from the two previous ones. Due to
memory and time constraints of this environment you will not be able to
train a model and use it for inference. Instead you will create the
necessary building blocks for the transformer encoder model and will use
a pretrained version of the same model in two ungraded labs after this
assignment.

After completing these 3 (1 graded and 2 ungraded) labs you will: *
Implement the code neccesary for Bidirectional Encoder Representation
from Transformer (BERT). * Understand how the C4 dataset is structured.
* Use a pretrained model for inference. * Understand how the ``Text to
Text Transfer from Transformers'' or T5 model works.

## Part 1: C4 Dataset

The https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4[C4] is a huge data
set. For the purpose of this assignment you will use a few examples out
of it which are present in `data.txt`. C4 is based on the
https://commoncrawl.org/[common crawl] project. Feel free to read more
on their website.

Run the cell below to see how the examples look like.

I\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in "file mode" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\nI\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\nThanks for pointing this out.

Notice the `b` before each string? This means that this data comes as
bytes rather than strings. Strings are actually lists of bytes so for
the rest of the assignments the name `strings` will be used to describe
the data.

To check this run the following cell:


+*In[14]:*+

### 1.1 Pre-Training Objective

*Note:* The word ``mask'' will be used throughout this assignment in
context of hiding/removing word(s)

You will be implementing the BERT loss as shown in the following image.

Assume you have the following text: *Thank you for inviting me to your
party last week*

Now as input you will mask the words in red in the text:

*Input:* Thank you *X* me to your party *Y* week.

*Output:* The model should predict the words(s) for *X* and *Y*.

*Z* is used to represent the end.

### 1.2 Process C4

C4 only has the plain string `text` field, so you will tokenize and have
`inputs` and `targets` out of it for supervised learning. Given your
inputs, the goal is to predict the targets during training.

You will now take the `text` and convert it to `inputs` and `targets`.

#### 1.2.1 Decode to natural language

The following functions will help you `detokenize` and`tokenize` the
text data.

The `sentencepiece` vocabulary was used to convert from text to ids.
This vocabulary file is loaded and used in this helper functions.

`natural_language_texts` has the text from the examples we gave you.

As you can see above, you were able to take a piece of string and
tokenize it.

Now you will create `input` and `target` pairs that will allow you to
train your model. T5 uses the ids at the end of the vocab file as
sentinels. For example, it will replace: - `vocab_size - 1` by `<Z>` -
`vocab_size - 2` by `<Y>` - and so forth.

It assigns every word a `chr`.

The `pretty_decode` function below, which you will use in a bit, helps
in handling the type when decoding. Take a look and try to understand
what the function is doing.

Notice that:

[source,python]
----
string.ascii_letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
----

*NOTE:* Targets may have more than the 52 sentinels we replace, but this
is just to give you an idea of things.

The functions above make your `inputs` and `targets` more readable. For
example, you might see something like this once you implement the
masking function below.

*  Input sentence: Younes and Lukasz were working together in the lab
yesterday after lunch.
* Input: Younes and Lukasz *Z* together in the *Y* yesterday after
lunch.
* Target: *Z* were working *Y* lab.

### 1.3 Tokenizing and Masking

You will now implement the `tokenize_and_mask` function. This function
will allow you to tokenize and mask input words with a noise
probability. We usually mask 15% of the words.

# Part 2: Transfomer

We now load a Transformer model checkpoint that has been pre-trained
using the above C4 dataset and decode from it. This will save you a lot
of time rather than have to train your model yourself. Later in this
notebook, we will show you how to fine-tune your model.

Start by loading in the model. We copy the checkpoint to local dir for
speed, otherwise initialization takes a very long time. Last week you
implemented the decoder part for the transformer. Now you will implement
the encoder part. Concretely you will implement the following.

### 2.1 Transformer Encoder

You will now implement the transformer encoder. Concretely you will
implement two functions. The first function is `FeedForwardBlock`.

#### 2.1.1 The Feedforward Block

The `FeedForwardBlock` function is an important one so you will start by
implementing it. To do so, you need to return a list of the following:

* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm[`tl.LayerNorm()`]
= layer normalization.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense[`tl.Dense(d_ff)`]
= fully connected layer.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.activation_fns.Relu[`activation`]
= activation relu, tanh, sigmoid etc.
* `dropout_middle` = we gave you this function (don’t worry about its
implementation).
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense[`tl.Dense(d_model)`]
= fully connected layer with same dimension as the model.
* `dropout_final` = we gave you this function (don’t worry about its
implementation).

You can always take a look at
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[trax documentation] if needed.

*Instructions*: Implement the feedforward part of the transformer. You
will be returning a list.

#### 2.1.2 The Encoder Block

The encoder block will use the `FeedForwardBlock`.

You will have to build two residual connections. Inside the first
residual connection you will have the `tl.layerNorm()`, `attention`, and
`dropout_` layers. The second residual connection will have the
`feed_forward`.

You will also need to implement `feed_forward`, `attention` and
`dropout_` blocks.

So far you haven’t seen the
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.Attention[`tl.Attention()`]
and
https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual[`tl.Residual()`]

### 2.1.3 The Transformer Encoder

Now that you have implemented the `EncoderBlock`, it is time to build
the full encoder. BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers is one such encoder.

You will implement its core code in the function below by using the
functions you have coded so far.

The model takes in many hyperparameters, such as the `vocab_size`, the
number of classes, the dimension of your model, etc. You want to build a
generic function that will take in many parameters, so you can use it
later. At the end of the day, anyone can just load in an API and call
transformer, but we think it is important to make sure you understand
how it is built. Let’s get started.

*Instructions:* For this encoder you will need a `positional_encoder`
first (which is already provided) followed by `n_layers` encoder blocks,
which are the same encoder blocks you previously built. Once you store
the `n_layers` `EncoderBlock` in a list, you are going to encode a
`Serial` layer with the following sublayers:

* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Branch[`tl.Branch`]:
helps with the branching and has the following sublayers:
** `positional_encoder`.
** https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.PaddingMask[`tl.PaddingMask()`]:
layer that maps integer sequences to padding masks.
* Your list of `EncoderBlock`s
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select[`tl.Select([0], n_in=2)`]:
Copies, reorders, or deletes stack elements according to indices.
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm[`tl.LayerNorm()`].
* https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Mean[`tl.Mean()`]:
Mean along the first axis.
* `tl.Dense()` with n_units set to n_classes.
* `tl.LogSoftmax()`

Please refer to the https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[trax
documentation] for further information.
