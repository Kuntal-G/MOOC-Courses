# ## L2 Normalization

# Before building the model you will need to define a function that applies L2 normalization to a tensor. This is very important because in this week's assignment you will create a custom loss function which expects the tensors it receives to be normalized. Luckily this is pretty straightforward:

# In[2]:


def normalize(x):
    return x / np.sqrt(np.sum(x * x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))


# Notice that the denominator can be replaced by `np.linalg.norm(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)` to achieve the same results and that Trax's numpy is being used within the function.

# In[3]:


tensor = numpy.random.random((2,5))
print(f'The tensor is of type: {type(tensor)}\n\nAnd looks like this:\n\n {tensor}')


# In[4]:


norm_tensor = normalize(tensor)
print(f'The normalized tensor is of type: {type(norm_tensor)}\n\nAnd looks like this:\n\n {norm_tensor}')


# Notice that the initial tensor was converted from a numpy array to a jax array in the process.

# ## Siamese Model

# To create a `Siamese` model you will first need to create a LSTM model using the `Serial` combinator layer and then use another combinator layer called `Parallel` to create the Siamese model. You should be familiar with the following layers (notice each layer can be clicked to go to the docs):
#    - [`Serial`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial) A combinator layer that allows to stack layers serially using function composition.
#    - [`Embedding`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Embedding) Maps discrete tokens to vectors. It will have shape `(vocabulary length X dimension of output vectors)`. The dimension of output vectors (also called `d_feature`) is the number of elements in the word embedding.
#    - [`LSTM`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM) The LSTM layer. It leverages another Trax layer called [`LSTMCell`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTMCell). The number of units should be specified and should match the number of elements in the word embedding.
#    - [`Mean`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Mean) Computes the mean across a desired axis. Mean uses one tensor axis to form groups of values and replaces each group with the mean value of that group.
#    - [`Fn`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) Layer with no weights that applies the function f, which should be specified using a lambda syntax. 
#    - [`Parallel`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel) It is a combinator layer (like `Serial`) that applies a list of layers in parallel to its inputs.
# 
# Putting everything together the Siamese model will look like this:

# In[5]:


vocab_size = 500
model_dimension = 128

# Define the LSTM model
LSTM = tl.Serial(
        tl.Embedding(vocab_size=vocab_size, d_feature=model_dimension),
        tl.LSTM(model_dimension),
        tl.Mean(axis=1),
        tl.Fn('Normalize', lambda x: normalize(x))
    )

# Use the Parallel combinator to create a Siamese model out of the LSTM 
Siamese = tl.Parallel(LSTM, LSTM)


# Next is a helper function that prints information for every layer (sublayer within `Serial`):

# In[6]:


def show_layers(model, layer_prefix):
    print(f"Total layers: {len(model.sublayers)}\n")
    for i in range(len(model.sublayers)):
        print('========')
        print(f'{layer_prefix}_{i}: {model.sublayers[i]}\n')

print('Siamese model:\n')
show_layers(Siamese, 'Parallel.sublayers')

print('Detail of LSTM models:\n')
show_layers(LSTM, 'Serial.sublayers')


# Try changing the parameters defined before the Siamese model and see how it changes!
# 
# You will actually train this model in this week's assignment. For now you should be more familiarized with creating Siamese models using Trax. **Keep it up!**
